# Staircase-Climbing-Robot
A Mobile robot specilized in staircase climbing by hybrid secition movement

The robot's design features a segmented structure with hybrid locomotion, incorporating wheels and lead screws for stability and adaptability. Using an Arduino Mega as its core controller, the robot integrates ultrasonic sensors for real-time stair detection and obstacle avoidance, achieving partial autonomy.

## Key highlights include:
1. Enhanced Functionality: The robot's segmented design ensures smooth navigation across varied stair dimensions while maintaining balance and precision.
2. Advanced Sensor Fusion: The integration of ultrasonic sensors allows real-time environment perception, ensuring safe and efficient stair climbing.
3. Industrial and Residential Applications: Potential uses include assisting elderly individuals in multi-level homes and enabling industrial inspections in hazardous areas.
4. Focus on Efficiency: The use of energy-efficient motors and lightweight materials enhances the robot's operational longevity and mobility.
